                Hi I'm Ethan, your trainer! I hope everyone has fun 
                and learns a lot! We are going to be going at a 
                pretty quick pace, it is a bootcamp after all! But with 
                hard work, I know we can do it!
            </p>

            <h2>How you will be evaluated.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Projects</li>
                <li>QC</li>
                <li>Self assesments</li>
                <li>Quizes</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How I conduct 1-on-1s and grade self assesments.</h2>
            <p>
                Each Monday I will send out self assesments prompts. These 
                prompts will contain questions about content we covered the 
                previous week. You will create a video answering these questions 
                and send that to me. I do not care how you record the video, even 
                if it's a phone. I also don't care where you upload the video, just 
                send me the link. (Unlisted Youtube videos are a pretty good option.) 
                The breakdown of how I grade is in the table below. There is room for 
                variance. If for example someone was awesome and middling they don't 
                necessarily get a 75%. It's just a ballpark estimate. Much like a real 
                interview situation, there is a little subjectivity involved. I'm always 
                open to hear counter points though if someone doesn't agree with their grade. 
                We can discuss it in a 1-on-1 session. 
            </p>

            <p>
                That brings me to my next topic. Monday afternoons I will be pulling 
                5 or 6 people randomly into a private breakout room to talk about any 
                concerns they may have and talk about their performance. If anyone would 
                like to meet with me then, or any other time. Just let me know, we can put 
                something on the schedule if need be.

                Open the dev console and take a look at the element 
                below. Notice the diffent layers we have set: padding, 
                border, and margin.

            <p>Type in the text box and hit enter to see

              is utilzing the event object. We will print a whole
              event first, then the target, then the value. Just 
              so you can explore different parts of the event object.
