## Presentation Fundamentals

Making a great first impression is something we should all strive for. Sometimes it 
can be a make it or break it situation, like an interview. This module goes over some 
common tips for a good presentation, as well as tips for making a good first impression 
in our new, rapidly increasing, work from home environments. 

### General Tips

* Have a powerpoint! (But don't rely on it completely, 50% demo if possible 50% slides!)
* Don't just read whatever is directly on the slides! (Slides should accentuate your presentation, not define it)
* Slides shouldn't be too crowded with content. 
* Slides should be attention grabbing and professional. (Find a preset that isn't already built into Google slides or Powerpoint.)
* You should have an agenda slide to set the expectations for the presentation and allude to what you will be talking about.
* Speak bold and with confidence. 
* Maintain eye contact. (For more western societies where that is expected. Some cultures find it rude.)
* Stay on time! (If given an alloted time for the presentation, stick to it! Practice beforehand and time yourself with a stopwatch! Cut down content and only focus on the most important areas if you need to.)
* Don't focus on any negatives! (You may have ran into challenges during whatever it is you are presenting about. But don't mention them! We want to focus on the positives. What did you accomplish?)
* When presenting with a team, have smooth handoffs. (Practice and have an understanding with your teammates about the handoffs. ex. "So now I'll pass it to my next team member to talk about..." "Thanks for that Hannah. Now we are..")

### Tips for giving presentations when working from home

* All the same rules apply above. (Should directly address the camera to make eye contact. This goes for online interviews as well, not just presentations!)
* When presenting with multiple people online, don't swap back and forth between sharing screens. Pick someone to be the designated "clicker" and just share that one person's screen. If you need to, some apps like zoom allow you to take control of another users screen. This will allow you to keep a seamless presentation while still allowing others to control the slides or show off a demo!
