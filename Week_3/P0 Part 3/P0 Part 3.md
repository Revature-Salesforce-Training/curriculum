## Project 0 Part 3

## Process Automation 

You will need to declaratively program automation for your chosen company that 
demonstrates your complete understanding of Salesforce process automation tools. 

These topics include 
* Workflows
* Process Builder
* Approval Processes
* Flows
* Validation Rules

> For this, you need to have at least two examples of each used in distinct ways. 

## SDLC 

Display your understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle by participating with your team in the correct usage of the Scrumban framework for Agile. 

## Presentation

You will present your completed project to the class. I will be expecting a powertpoint or google slides presetation as well as a live demo of 
your ORG and LWC OSS site. You should aim for 50/50 slides and demo. The presentation should not exceed 10 minutes in length.
