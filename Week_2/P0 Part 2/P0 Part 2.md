## Project 0 - Part 2

This phase of the project will continue with the business or company that you chose 
for part 1, but will focus on beginning to implement a Salesforce org for that 
enterprise. 

## Data Model 

You will need to create a thorough data model, beginning with an ERD and following 
through with its implementation inside the org. The data model should display your 
understanding of data modeling and how to implement a data model inside Salesforce. 
The knowledge demonstrated needs to include ERD's, object creation and customization, 
field creation and customization, and relationships. 

* Minimum of 8 objects that are a mix of standard/custom (and the 8 does not include any junction objects)
* At least one many to many relationship

## Security 

You will need to establish the role hierarchy and multiple users for the system. Create 
distinct profiles and permission sets as well. The security should display your complete 
understanding of salesforce security and access, including Org Level, Object Level, 
Record Level, and Field Level. 

* Your ORG should have at least 3 users. 

* You should be able to explain the profiles that you've created and show some of the differences between them (e.g. one profile may have the ability to create records of object x, while another profile does not). 

* If any users in your org have the same profile, at least one should have a permission set that gives them additional capabilities - display the permission set(s) and the extra access that they bestow.

* Discuss the different roles held by each of your users and show their place in your orgs role hierarchy.

## User Interface 

Display the use of Page Layouts, Record types, List Views, and Dynamic Forms. 

* Display your record types (you should have at least two record types for at least one object) and the differences between them (whether through different picklists or different page layouts).

## SDLC
Display your understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle by participating with 
your team in the correct usage of the Scrumban framework for Agile.
