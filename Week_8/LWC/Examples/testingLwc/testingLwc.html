        Unit Tests vs End-to-End Tests
        - Unit Tests
          - Intended to test 1 thing and only 1
          - If evertyhing is unit tested, the system integrity is enhanced
          - Easy to write, and catches defects early and quickly
        - End-to-End Tests
          - Intented to test the application from start to finish
          - Tests a flow and ensures components communicate properly

        Salesforce calls out these testing methodologies and points out that End to End tests will require
        constant maintenance due to the ever-changing standards around HTML and modern web components.
        Salesforce also recommends that for any end-to-end tests we use Selenium WebDriver. We won't be going into
        end-to-end testing, but we will be taking a look at unit testing via Jest
