## Welcome to Revature!

Hi everyone! I'm looking forward to working with all of you. We have a lot to cover 
in the coming weeks, and I won't lie, it will not be easy. But here is my 
guarantee to you all: You work hard, study, and really give me your all to run this 
marathon of content. You do that for me and I will also give my all to make sure everyone 
gets their certifications and launches the start of their new tech career!

With that said this is a collaborative workplace environment and place of learning. So 
let's both (me and everyone in the cohort) work for eachother to have some fun and 
get your new careers kicked off!

### The Curriculum

As you can see everything is broken down by week, with each of the topics having their 
own folder. You will find the lecture notes for each topic in those folders, as well 
as any relevant examples or exercises. Some of the lecture notes may be long form (LF) or 
smaller bullet point lecture notes (LN). I suggest you read everything and do so multiple 
times as we progress. Yes this is similar to college, you will need to study thouroughly. 
However, don't be fooled by the "college feel". This is first and foremost a workplace 
and I have expectations for all of you. Remember what we talked about above? This will be 
a collaborative process, we need to work together to achieve success!

### Projects

Our projects and their requirements will be found on GitHub as well. For P0, you will notice 
that it is broken down into three parts. Each week we will be exploring new content that 
will build on (and add new requirements) to your first project.
