## Welcome to Revature!

Hi everyone! I'm looking forward to working with all of you. We have a lot to cover 
in the coming weeks, and I won't lie, it will not be easy. But here is my 
guarantee to you all: You work hard, study, and really give me your all to run this 
marathon of content. You do that for me and I will also give my all to make sure everyone 
gets their certifications and launches the start of their new tech career!

With that said this is a collaborative workplace environment and place of learning. So 
let's both (me and everyone in the cohort) work for each other to have some fun and 
get your new careers kicked off!

### The Curriculum

As you can see everything is broken down by week, with each of the topics having their 
own folder. You will find the lecture notes for each topic in those folders, as well 
as any relevant examples or exercises. Some of the lecture notes may be long form (LF) or 
smaller lecture notes (LN). I suggest you read everything and do so multiple 
times as we progress. Yes this is similar to college, you will need to study thouroughly. 
However, don't be fooled by the "college feel". This is first and foremost a workplace 
and I have expectations for all of you. Remember what we talked about above? This will be 
a collaborative process, we need to work together to achieve success!

### How you are evaluated

* Projects
* Self Assessments
* QC
* Quizzes

**No plagiarism will be tolerated.**

### Projects

4 Projects in total (starting at zero index)

- P0 & P1 - Indvidual project (P1 is presented as a team, however)
- P2 & P3 - Team based projects

P3 - Final project, cohort wide team, often presented to clients.

Our projects and their requirements will be found here on GitHub.

### Self Assesments

Each Monday I will send out self assesments prompts. These 
prompts will contain questions about content we covered the 
previous week. You will create a video answering these questions 
and send that to me. Questions should be answered as if you were in 
the context of an interview setting. I do not care how you record the video, 
even if it's a phone. I also don't care where you upload the video, just 
send me the link. (Unlisted Youtube videos are a pretty good option.) 
The breakdown of how I grade is in the table below. There is room for 
variance. If for example someone got :thumbsup: and :no_entry: they don't 
necessarily get a 75%. It's just a ballpark estimate. Much like a real 
interview situation, there is a little subjectivity involved.

I will also pull people into 1-on-1 sessions in a zoom breakout room randomly on Mondays. 
This is to talk about any concerns you may have and to get a sense of where we are at.

Completing your self assessments should be your first priority after completing the quizzes on Mondays.


| 50%          | 50%          |      |
|--------------|--------------|------|
| Soft Skills  | Correctness  |      |
| :thumbsup:   | :thumbsup:   | 100% |
| :thumbsup:   | :no_entry:   | 75%  |
| :no_entry:   | :no_entry:   | 50%  |
| :no_entry:   | :thumbsdown: | 25%  |
| :thumbsdown: | :thumbsdown: | 0%   |

### QC

Tuesday mornings (usually) we will split up into breakout rooms and soon trainers will join your room 
to begin the QC process. They will go around the group asking questions about content we learned the 
week prior. This is similar to our self assesments, where a mix of soft skills and content knowledge is 
necessary for a good score. 

Possible ratings:
Red, Orange, Yellow, Lime, Green, Blue Star

### Quizzes

A mix of multiple choice and short answer questions. We take our quizzes on RevPro.

### Grading Scale

For weeks with a project presentation:
50% - project 
25% - self assesment 
25% - Quizzes

Weeks without a project:
50% - Self assesment
50% - Quizzes

>QC is seperate from the rest of our evaluations. But still very important! It's how we can make sure you are interview ready!
