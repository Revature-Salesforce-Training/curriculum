# Presentations

Throughout your time here at Revature, you will need to make various presentations, at the very least four distinct ones for projects 0 - 3. It is not just Revature where these skills will be valuable; as you grow in your career, you will need to make presentations showcasing the projects and plans you and your team are responsible for. These may be to your manager, your manager's manager, or even the ceo of the company you work for, all the way down to one just for your own team to see.

The concept of a lone programmer sitting alone and not talking to anyone is a myth in the modern world, and so you will need to be able to present your work. Here are some key points we want you to keep in mind during your time with us.

## Basic Format

The basic format we expect during showcases are a combination of live demos and slides. Starting with your slide deck, you can introduce the context for the project, and following that, we will see the project in action. Finally, after the demo, you may want to address future plans and iterations, alongside offering an opportunity to take questions from the audience.

When you are going through the slides portion the structure we like to see the following:

- What the project's name is, and who the team behind it is. This can be an opening slide with the project name and those who worked on it.
- What was the problem presented for you to solve? So what were you and your team tasked with? This provides the context for everything that follows.
- How did you and your team organize to provide the problem's solution, and what did you use for it? Talk about your SDLC process, break down the team structure, and mention the different technologies leveraged for the solution. 
- What was your solution? This part should be an overview of what you did. We will also be going over this in the live demo, but this is where you want to mention things that are cumbersome to demo or would require many repetitions to demo correctly.
- Live Demo. Once you have covered the outline, you demo the result of your project.
- Future Iterations & Challenges. After the demo is over is an excellent time to return to address challenges faced and future development plans. We will touch on this in more detail shortly.
- End Slide prompting for questions. This section should note the end of the presentation and, if applicable, that the floor is open for questions.

### Attitude

When it comes to giving a presentation, the attitude of the presenters is essential. If you are bored and don't care about what you are presenting the audience will notice and reflect it. Instead, you want to ensure that you present the project with excitement and enthusiasm, albeit without coming across as fake or manic either. 

Sometimes people will try for humor to spice things up, but I would avoid it. Humor is subjective, and depending on its nature, it can fall flat with relative ease. Moreover, what you and your squad think is funny after growing comfortable with each other may not land well with strangers.

### Slides

Slides are the vast majority of the time misused, which has led to many people disliking powerpoint presentations in general. The critical thing to note is that slides are not the basis for your presentation; they supplement it as a visual aid. To this end, the slides should be constructed with that in mind.

- Slides are a visual medium; you should avoid walls of text and make good use of imagery to supplement your speech.
- When text is on a slide, it should supplement what you are saying and not be repeated verbatim by the speaker. An audience can read faster than you can talk, and reading from a slide results in a bored audience waiting for you to catch up.
- Slides should not be identical slide after slide, this predictability aids in an audience growing bored. Instead, mix things up, so each slide feels fresh.
- Just as slides should not be identical, they should have a common theme; it shouldn't feel like each slide was pulled from a random slide deck.

I highly recommend https://slidesgo.com as a free source of visually attractive slide templates that can aid you in your endeavors.

### Live Demo

The live demo portion is the critical part where you show off your work in action. You should ensure a logical flow to your demonstration, which we will also touch upon in the narrative structure portion. The live demo should be a chance to show off your project's functionality. 

Not everything, though, works well in a live demo. For example, if you implemented security so that ten different people logging in would have access to ten different things, that is likely to grow stale quickly. Show off just one of these instances and mention the others. In cases where the specifics are less demo-friendly, speak about them in the slide deck.

### Challenges

Inevitably a feature or even a whole project does not go as planned. It is common to want to defend your work and justify the issues, and frequently associates will seek to do so in a showcase. You should not. The showcase is not a place to air grievances, throw past iterations under the bus, or make excuses.

1. The audience is likely unaware that the feature you demonstrated only had half the functionality you planned. Telling them this only reduces your stature in their eyes, not enhance it.
2. Throwing past teams, or worse, current teammates under the bus, comes across as wholly unprofessional, no matter how justified you may feel it is. Presentations are not the time or place to address them.
3. While it may serve to get things off your chest, it offers no benefit to the presentation.

Instead, if you are missing a key feature, it is better to address it not as a failure of the current iteration but as a feature to be implemented in a future sprint. Frame it is to be done, not as something failed to get done. This can address audience concerns of why a feature mentioned as one of the key use cases is missing and not hurt their overall impression of the project.

Finally, if you really must address a challenge, address it in a way that emphasizes the solution, not the problem itself. For example, if a critical feature had a major delay and resulted in it only being partially implemented, address it about how you worked to overcome it and the solution the team came up with to solve it. This allows you to address the concern while also highlighting your success in dealing with it rather than just dwelling on the issue itself.

## Narrative Structure

When you are doing a project demo, it can sometimes be unclear to an audience member what its purpose is without additional context. A narrative structure can help with this and provide a logical flow to the demo. 

For example someone jumping between three distinct features might technically show it off, but if you could instead weave a narrative, it can give the use and why we care about those three features context.

"Today, we want to introduce Jane, they are a customer of the client, and when they first open the app, they see that they are prompted to log in. Having the customer log in it allows us to maintain a history of their past orders and support tickets so our service agents can quickly assist Jane should she need it. Upon logging in, Jane wants to check her reward point balance, which we can see in the top left of the screen. Jane notices she has enough points to redeem for a free product. By clicking the redeem button, we can see a list of all redeemable rewards; those requiring more points than jane has are greyed out and unselectable...."

In the above example, we know a few things from the context given. It is an app used by a customer, we track order and support ticket history internally for our service agents, and customers must log in to the app. Once inside, we have a feature that displays reward points and a redeem feature that displays the rewards available to customers. We navigate through as an actual user would, further understanding the use and purpose of the app. 

Without the narrative context, we still know parts of that, but if the audience is unfamiliar with the business and project, they might be lost on what precisely some of these features are. If we then demonstrated the reward points counter, the login, and the redeem option, we might also lose the audience in terms of how it all ties together.

A narrative structure gives us an easy-to-understand context for the project and how it works and gives us an easy-to-follow logical flow.

## Practice

Once you set up the outline of your presentation, create the slides, and decide on a flow for the live demo, we must then practice. Invariably something will happen when doing it live. The more you have practiced the presentation, the less likely it is to happen, or if it does, the better you can recover.

Practice allows you to find things that do not work or break that you might have missed beforehand. For instance, you might start and realize that you have no mock data in the demo, which could be a significant issue in a live scenario. Additionally, something that seemed fine written down might come across awkward or clumsy said aloud. The more you practice the more polished and professional the final showcase will be.

### Timing

Time limits are essential; you need to address the topics and efficiently convey your message. Talking endlessly, repeating yourself all make for a dull presentation. Keep it short, snappy, and engaging and not longer just for the sake of being long. Presentations will have some time limit assigned, and if you are given 5 minutes and every practice run is coming in at just the 5-minute mark, it will be too long. When you are in front of an audience, nerves and other things can creep in and eat away at the time. So make sure you are giving yourself a buffer.


### The Cooking Show Method

Sometimes, you will find that you are losing time waiting when doing a practice run. For example, the page takes a while to load, the callout to an external service can occasionally hang, or maybe there is a bug that made it into the system, so a page fails to load one out of five times. That would be something to fix, but a code freeze has taken place for this sprint, and you do not want that to happen during the showcase.

Well, much like a holiday cooking show demonstrating how to make a delicious turkey puts the uncooked turkey in one oven and then opens another to show the final result; we can do the same. You can identify spots during practice and have those pages loaded up with the results ready. For example, this is useful when you want to show a record being created but do not want to fill out 10+ required fields and have everyone watch you type in the information for a minute. You can start it off, showcase the save button, then switch tabs to a completed record to continue with the next part of the demo.

### Scripts

Scripts are a double-edged sword for presentations and should be avoided wherever possible for the actual presentation. Writing one ahead of time to figure out the flow of what you want to say, followed by practice, allows you to separate yourself from the script at presentation time. In addition, you need to address the audience and not be looking at a script off to the side.

Additionally, a reason to move away from scripts is that if you memorize a script and lose your spot, you can start a mental chain reaction and suddenly blanking in the middle of it all.

Finally, script reading, aside from being painfully obvious, is also often very wooden and leads you to not convey the excitement and engagement with the audience we want you to have.

I recommend starting by creating a general outline of what you want to say and then trimming it down to a series of bullet points. You can glance over to remind yourself of the topics you want to touch on and trust your expertise of the project to elaborate as needed. Practice will further help you hone in on this.

## Q&A

Last but not least, at the end of a presentation, you will often be asked questions, certainly in a project showcase. This can be far-ranging, and they might want to delve into the specifics of certain features. When a team is answering questions, we don't want team members speaking over one another, nor do we want everyone remaining quiet, expecting someone else to answer. To solve this, we use the team lead as a router, channeling the question to the person most familiar with the topic. In larger teams with multiple subteams, the team lead will direct it to the relevant subteam lead, who then directs it further as needed. 

In cases where the question is asked for the entire team, the team lead should still be directing it, calling on people to give their answer in turn. This allows for a neat and orderly Q&A.

## Bullet Points - General Tips

* Have a powerpoint! (But don't rely on it completely, 50% demo if possible 50% slides!)
* Don't just read whatever is directly on the slides! (Slides should accentuate your presentation, not define it)
* Slides shouldn't be too crowded with content. 
* Slides should be attention grabbing and professional. (Find a preset that isn't already built into Google slides or Powerpoint.)
* You should have an agenda slide to set the expectations for the presentation and allude to what you will be talking about.
* Speak bold and with confidence. 
* Maintain eye contact. (For more western societies where that is expected. Some cultures find it rude.)
* Stay on time! (If given an alloted time for the presentation, stick to it! Practice beforehand and time yourself with a stopwatch!)
* Don't focus on any negatives! (You may have ran into challenges during whatever it is you are presenting about. But we want to focus on the positives. What did you accomplish?)
* When presenting with a team, have smooth handoffs. (Practice and have an understanding with your teammates about the handoffs. ex. "So now I'll pass it to my next team member to talk about..." "Thanks for that Hannah. Now we are..")
* Show don't tell. Stay feature focused. What does that mean?
  * Present as if your audience is a client, not a room full of other developers
  * This means avoiding technical jargon, as well as avoiding showing off the "how" of your solutions. Meaning we shoudln't be looking at a vscode screen or terminal, we should be showing off the features in action, from the end user's perspective.
  * Same goes for declaritive customizations in a Salesforce org like a flow builder screen. We should be looking at the end result, a webpage or the end result of that flow we created from the user's perspective.

### Tips for giving presentations when working from home

* All the same rules apply above. (Should directly address the camera to make eye contact. This goes for online interviews as well, not just presentations!)
* When presenting with multiple people online, don't swap back and forth between sharing screens. Pick someone to be the designated "clicker" and just share that one person's screen. If you need to, some apps like zoom allow you to take control of another users screen. This will allow you to keep a seamless presentation while still allowing others to control the slides or show off a demo!
* Have a professional background while on camera. If working with a team, strive to all have the same background.
