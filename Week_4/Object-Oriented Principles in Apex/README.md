# Object-Oriented Principles in Apex

Purpose of this module is to introduce the pillars of object-oriented programming and how they are implemented in Apex.

* [Lecture Notes](<./LNObject-Oriented Principles in Apex.md>)
* [Longform](<./LFObject-Oriented Principles in Apex.md>)
* [Exercises]()

## List of Topics

* Constructors
* Encapsulation
  * Access Modifiers
  * Properties
  * Static & Instance
* Abstraction
  * Abstract Class
  * Interfaces
* Inheritance
  * Extends & Implements Keywords
  * This & Super Keywords

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, associates should be able to

* Define the static keyword
* Define encapsulation and how its controlled in Apex (access modifiers and properties)
* Describe abstraction and how its controlled in Apex (abstract classes and interfaces)
* Explain inheritance and how its controlled in Apex (extending classes and implementing interfaces)
* Write the correct syntax to extend a class and/or implement an interface
* Define polymorphism and how its controlled in Apex (method overloading and method overriding)
* Differentiate between method overloading and method overriding
* Define the virtual keyword
* Explain the role of super, this(), and this. in Apex
* Define an inner class and explain how many nested layers of inner classes can be used
* Describe constructors and the default constructor
* Explain constructor chaining
